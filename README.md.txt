# CSC3400-CalamityCastle
Repo containing Unity source files for Kurt Faerber's CSC 3440 final project, Calamity Castle

Pull down this repo, then add the directory to Unity and open the project. Unity should import all the assets and set up the project as necessary in order to view it in the editor. Alternatively, you can find all of the code I personally wrote in the `Assets/Scripts/` directory.
